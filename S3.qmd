### Introduction

```{r}
library(sloop)
```

An S3 object is a base type with at least a class attribute. An S3 object behaves differently from its underlying base type whenever it's passed to a *generic function*


### Classes

Interestingly, S3 has no formal definition of a class, you simply set the class attribute to make an object an instance of that class.

S3 has no checks for correctness which means you can change the class of existing objects (dangerous!)

To avoid errors there are three main functions that you should provide when creating your own class

- a constructor `new_myclass()` that creates objects with the correct structure
- a validator `validate_myclass()`
- A user-friendly helper, `myclass()`, that provides a convenient way for others to create objects of your class.
