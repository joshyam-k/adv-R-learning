### Introduction

Function factories are functions that make functions

simple example:

```{r}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

square <- power1(2)
cube <- power1(3)

square(4)
```

`power1` is used to create child functions

There are three components that make this possible

- R has first class functions
- In R a function captures (encloses) the environment in which it is created.
- In R a function creates a new execution environment every time it is run
